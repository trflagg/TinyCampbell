			<h2>Good morning Employee #<script type='text/javascript'>document.write(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000));</script></h2>
			<p>Welcome to another great day at TWM Inc.</p>
			<p>Please make sure you have read the operator's manual prior to turning on your machine. Should you have any problems, please contact Sandra at ext.7106.</p>
		
			<h2>Operator's Manual</h2>
			<p>Use the keyboard to select a resource mode and the mouse to paint the resource in the world:
				<ul>
					<li>w - water. Generates fish.</li>
					<li>g - grass. Generates plants.</li>
					<li>m - mountain. Bears and hunters may not cross mountains.</li>
					<li>e - erase. Remove resource.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Press r to toggle machine run mode.</p>
			<p>Achieve goals to gain culture. EVERY EMPLOYEE MUST MEET CULTURE QUOTA BEFORE LEAVING FOR THE DAY!</p>
			
			<h2>About TWM Inc.</h2>
			<p>Given the scope of several millenia, the world can be seen as one large machine. Natural resources go in, and produced in return is the only thing in the world with true lasting value: human culture! To cut through the millenia of work necessary to produce culture, TMW Inc. has invented the Tiny World Machine. </p>
			<p>TWM Inc.'s Tiny World Machines greatly improve the culture building process by shrinking it down to a 32x32 grid. Our operators work 7 days a week on our machines, dutifully spending resources and creating self-perpetuating ecosystems which give rise to culture as efficiently as possible. </p>
			
			<h2>Keys to success in the workplace</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The machine begins stopped. You must press r to start the machine and begin producing life.</li>
				<li>Bears and hunters fill up every time they eat. Create migration patterns to discourage overeating.</li>
				<li>The hunter camp only operates along shorelines. It must have its lower-left corner on empty land that has water next to it.</li>
				<li>Click the lower-left corner of the camp to move it.</li>
			</ul>
